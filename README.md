## OPTIONAL: Question for the reviewer
 
If you have any question about the starter code or your own implementation, please add it in the cell below. 

For example, if you want to know why a piece of code is written the way it is, or its function, or alternative ways of implementing the same functionality, or if you want to get feedback on a specific part of your code or get feedback on things you tried but did not work.

Please keep your questions succinct and clear to help the reviewer answer them satisfactorily. 

> I know I don't have many comments and my read_me is basically non-existant, but before I fully finished this project with comments, docustrings, ReadMe and code clean-up I wanted to know:
How I can best parse a timestamp stored in int format.  As right now everything is set to the default date of 1970-01-01 with the hours, minutes, and seconds only able to be parsed from the pd.datetime function call.
See the process_time_dim() function for how I am currently parsing the file.
